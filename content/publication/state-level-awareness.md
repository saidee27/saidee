abstract = "**Introduction**: This study examined state-level variation in chronic kidney disease (CKD) awareness using national estimates of disease awareness among adults in the U.S. with CKD. **Methods**: Data on U.S. adults were obtained from two national, population-based surveys: (1) the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS 2011; n=506,467), a state-level phone survey containing information on self-reported kidney disease; and (2) the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES 2005–2012; n=20,831), containing physical health examination, surveys containing data on self-reported kidney disease, risk factors, and laboratory values. CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 15–59 mL/minute/1.73 m2 or urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio >30 mg/g. As BRFSS does not include laboratory data, CKD status for each person was imputed (multiple) based on a logistic regression model predicting NHANES CKD status. CKD awareness in each state was estimated as the weighted proportion of BRFSS participants with imputed CKD who reported having kidney disease. **Results**: Overall, estimated CKD awareness was 9.0% (95% CI=8.0%, 10.0%), ranging from 5.8% (95% CI=4.8%, 6.8%) in Iowa to 11.7% (95% CI=9.7%, 13.7%) in Arizona. Awareness was greater among adults with hypertension (12.0%) and diabetes (15.3%) than among adults without those conditions, and lower in Hispanics (6.0%) than in non-Hispanic whites (8.8%), non-Hispanic blacks (9.9%), and other racial/ethnic groups (12.7%). **Conclusions**: Among individuals with CKD, awareness of their condition was very low and varied approximately twofold among states. This is the first study to estimate awareness of kidney disease by state for the U.S. adult population."
