# Biography

I am a PhD student in Biostatistics at the University of Michigan. My dissertation research is in the area of competing risks and survival analysis. During my Masters', I worked as a Research Assistant at the Univeristy of Michigan Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center. Prior to coming to Michigan, I was a Quantitative Research Analyst at Acumen, LLC and before that I was a graduate student and Research Assistant at the University of Mississippi Department of Pharmacy Administration.

Here's a link to my [CV](/pdf/SaiDharmarajan_CVI.pdf).

My average day consists of drinking 5 cups of tea and getting yelled at plenty. Here's a picture of me making passers by at Michigan Diag stare in disbelief, scratch their heads and crack a smile.
