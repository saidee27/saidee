# Biography

I am a (final year) PhD student in [Biostatistics](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) at the [University of Michigan](umich.edu). I am advised by Prof. Douglas E. Schaubel. My research is mainly in the area of survival analysis with applications in the end stage renal disease setting. My dissertation research is specifically foscused on developing statistical methods for (i) analyzing clustered competing risks data and (ii) [causal inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_inference) using [instrumental variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_variables_estimation) for time-to-event data. I also work as a research assistant at the [University of Michigan Kidney Epidemiology and Cost Center](https://kecc.sph.umich.edu/), contributing to the [Chronic Kidney Disease Surveillance System](https://nccd.cdc.gov/ckd/) and the [United States Renal Data System](https://www.usrds.org/) projects. Prior to coming to Michigan, I was a Quantitative Research Analyst at [Acumen, LLC](http://www.acumenllc.com/) and before that I was a graduate student and research assistant at [Department of Pharmacy Administration, The University of Mississippi](https://pharmacy.olemiss.edu/phad/).

Here's my [CV](/pdf/SaiDharmarajan_CVI.pdf).
